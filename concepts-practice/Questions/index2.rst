Practice Strategy:
Beginner Level (1-30): Focus on forms, basic state, and simple components
Intermediate Level (31-70): Work on custom hooks, navigation, and complex state
Advanced Level (71-100): Master API integration, animations, and performance optimization
Recommended Learning Path:

Master forms (Questions 1-20) - Essential for most apps
Deep dive into state (Questions 21-40) - Core React Native skill
Build custom hooks (Questions 41-55) - Reusability and abstraction
Learn navigation (Questions 56-70) - App structure
API mastery (Questions 71-85) - Real-world data handling
Polish with animations (Questions 86-100) - Professional finish
